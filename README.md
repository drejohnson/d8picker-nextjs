School Calendar was an app idea brought to Lambda from a school coach. The coach would like a calendar that he could update with various events and push to a larger source i.e. google, outlook, or Ical.

Along with these things notifying changes to a schedule the coach would like to update things inside the events such as time and location. The last key feature would be event templates that can be placed in bulk across unrelated days.

## :six: Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. These variables are stored securely on Heroku.

-   DATABASE_URL
-   JWT_SECRET
-   SEED_PASSWORD
-   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
-   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN

## :seven: Credentials

## :eight: Open Questions ❓

-   What if a users want to use their Google credential to log into the application?
-   Can the application push existing calendars and/or events to a user's Google calendar or Apple Calendar?
-   How can an calendar creator restrict access to the calendar subscribers.  For example, a subscriber may view the event but can not edit or delete the event.
-   What are some ways for a user to get notify of a new events?
-   Imagine a calendar is full of events, how to can a user search for an interested event? Should the search algorithm be built from scratch or using existing third-party service such as Algolia.
